Dataset: 
US accidents Dataset with 3.5 million records and 49 columns including weather conditions, Turning loop, wind 
speed etc collected from Kaggle is used in this project. It covers countrywide car accidents which includes 49 states of the USA. 
The accident data are collected from February 2016 to June 2020.

We are trying to find the attributes with which the accuracy of prediction is high. We will be mainly considering spatial features 
and the time features. Since most of the accidents are highly correlated with these attributes.
